TokenPod | Public Landing & Onboarding Manifest
======================================================

The Public Landing page (v6.9) is the primary gateway for reward hunters. It is designed to demonstrate speed and security immediately.

1. VISUAL IDENTITY (STUDIO WHITE PROTOCOL)
------------------------------------------
- Primary Accent: Vibrant Orange (#ff7a21).
- Typography: Heavy-weight Inter (Black/900) for headers, sleek Slate (#64748b) for labels.
- Layout: Vertically oriented for mobile-first professional utility.

2. HERO COMPONENT: HYPER-SYNC DEMO
----------------------------------
- Interaction: An automated "Live Speed Test" card simulates the core app experience.
- Phases: 
    1. SCANNING: A 0-100% progress bar fills over 3 seconds.
    2. SIGNAL DETECTED: The card glows orange and enables a "CLAIM NOW" button.
    3. POINT COLLECTED: Haptic feedback confirms the simulation success.
- Purpose: Educates the user on the "Ready" state visual language before they sign up.

3. GLOBAL COMMUNITY FEED (TOP 5)
--------------------------------
- Data Logic: Fetches project frequency from the Master Shards via `FETCH_TRENDING_PUBLIC`.
- Display Rule: Limited strictly to the Top 5 projects to ensure a high-signal, clean experience.
- Features: 
    - Real-time Trend Score (% calculation based on shard tally).
    - High-quality icon resolution via the iTunes software API.
    - Blue "Community" icon distinguishes user-tracked signals from static partner apps.

4. UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY GRID
-------------------------------
Highlights the scope of TokenPod tracking:
- Telegram Bots: Notcoin, Hamster, Dogs.
- Node Mining: Grass, Xenea, Nodle.
- Mobile Apps: Pi Network, Bee Network.
- Daily Rewards: Streaks & Check-ins.

5. PRIVACY & SECURITY GATE
--------------------------
- Privacy Rules: Explicitly lists "No Email," "No Keys," and "Zero Tracking."
- Identity Protocol: Registration requires only a Nickname and a 4-Digit PIN.
- Hashing: PINs are hashed using SHA-256 locally before being transmitted to the sharded ledger.

6. ONBOARDING UX: HOLD-TO-CONFIRM
---------------------------------
- The Finish Button: Uses the `useHoldToConfirm` hook (1.0s duration).
- Visual Feedback: A white progress overlay fills the orange button as the user presses down.
- Rationale: Prevents accidental account creation and reinforces the "Secure" nature of the vault setup.

7. ACCESS POINTS
----------------
- Start Tracking: Smooth-scrolls to the registration form.
- Restore Account: Switches the interface to the Login view.
- Footer: Persistent access to the Protocol Academy (App Guide).
